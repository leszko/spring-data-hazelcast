Welcome to Spring Data Hazelcast project!

toc::[]

The primary goal of the Spring Data project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. 

Spring Data Hazelcast project will enable the Spring Data paradigm to gain the power of a distributed data repository.

=== Mail Group

Please, http://groups.google.com/group/hazelcast[join the mail group] if you are interested in using or developing Hazelcast.

== Motivation

The Spring platform is a commonly used environment and Hazelcast is the most widely used IMDG. 
Therefore it is natural to provide a way to use Hazelcast via Spring in a standard, platform neutral manner and to provide a baseline implementation of Spring Data Hazelcast that can be enhanced with Hazelcast specific features.

The implementation is built on the new Spring Data https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue[KeyValue] module and is one of the first projects to do this. 
This module provides infrastructure components for creating repository abstractions for stores dealing with Key/Value pairs like `java.util.Map` or Hazelcast `IMap`.

Through the means of the repository interface, CRUD operations, and expression-based query methods can interrogate an in-memory data store in a manner consistent with the other Spring Data projects allowing developers to be productive quickly and easily.

== Features

- Familiar "Spring Data" approach,  developers do not need to learn a new technology to be able to use it
- Utilizes the new Spring-Data-Key value abstraction, we did not reinvent the wheel
- ​*FURTHER*​ eases the integration of Hazelcast into Spring and clouds
- Reduces vendor lock-in. One can swap Hazelcast in place of more expensive or slower options
- @Query Support

== Usage

.Spring Configuration
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableHazelcastRepositories(basePackages={"example.springdata.keyvalue.chemistry"}) // <1>
public class ApplicationConfiguration {

    @Bean
    HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance() {     // <2> 
        return Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        // return HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();
    }

    @Bean
    public KeyValueOperations keyValueTemplate() {  // <3> 
        return new KeyValueTemplate(new HazelcastKeyValueAdapter(hazelcastInstance()));
    }

    @Bean
    public HazelcastKeyValueAdapter hazelcastKeyValueAdapter(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
        return new HazelcastKeyValueAdapter(hazelcastInstance);
    }
}
----
<1> Enables Spring Data magic for Hazelcast. 
    You can specify `basePackages` for component scan.
<2> Instantiates Hazelcast instance (a member or a client)
<3> Instantiates KV template

.A repository class definition
[source,java]
----
public interface SpeakerRepository extends HazelcastRepository<Speaker, Long> {}
----

.A test of repository
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = AppConfiguration.class)
public class AppTest {
    @Autowired
    SpeakerRepository speakerRepository;

    @Test
    public void testStart(){
        speakerRepository.findAll();
    }
}

----

== Sample @Query Usages
Query with hardcoded value
[source,java]
----
@Query("firstname=James")
public List<Person> peoplewiththeirFirstNameIsJames();
----
Query with one variable
[source,java]
----
@Query("firstname=%s")
public List<Person> peoplewiththeirFirstName(String firstName);
----
Query with multiple variable values
[source,java]
----
@Query("firstname=%s and lastname=%s")
public List<Person> peoplewithFirstAndLastName(String firstName,String lastName);
----

== Supported Query Keywords
----
True
False
Equal
NotEqual
Before
